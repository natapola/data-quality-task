### Data Quality Insights

This document summarizes key data quality issues identified across the datasets provided.

### Customers Table
- Total rows: **1000**
- **100 unique full names** and **100 unique email addresses**
- Other rows are duplicate values
- Email addresses are randomly assigned and do not match customer names

### Products Table
- Total rows: **1000**
- **1000 unique product IDs**, no duplicates
- Only **6 products** from **2 categories** were sold
- **Price format is invalid**: values contain excessive decimal places, possibly due to currency conversion or incorrect formatting

### Transactions Table
- Total rows: **1000**, no duplicates
- **44 negative values** in the `amount` column
- **Missing transaction date** for `transaction_id = 7`
- `amount` values do **not match** product `price`, which suggests a potential issue in the data pipeline  
- This discrepancy may indicate incorrect calculations, discounts, currency conversion, or mismatched sources  
- Further investigation would require access to transformation logic or additional metadata to trace the root cause
- **Transaction dates are not in sequential order** relative to transaction IDs

#### General Observations
- All files use **semicolon (;)** as the delimiter
- There is **no foreign key relationship** between the `customers` and `transactions` tables
