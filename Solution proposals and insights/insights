Data Quality Insights
This document summarizes key data quality issues identified across the datasets provided.

1. Customers Table
- Total rows: 1000
- 100 unique full names and 100 unique email addresses
- Other rows are duplicate values
- Email addresses are randomly assigned and do not match customer names


2. Products Table
- Total rows: 1000
- 1000 unique product IDs, no duplicates
- Only 6 products from 2 categories were sold
- Price format is invalid: values contain excessive decimal places, possibly due to currency conversion or incorrect formatting


3. Transactions Table
- Total rows: 1000, no duplicates
- 44 negative values in the amount column
- Missing transaction date for transaction_id = 7
- Amount values do not match product price, which suggests a potential issue in the data pipeline

This discrepancy may indicate incorrect calculations, discounts, currency conversion, or mismatched sources
Further investigation would require access to transformation logic or additional metadata to trace the root cause

- Transaction dates are not in sequential order relative to transaction IDs


4. General Observations
- All files use semicolon (;) as the delimiter
- There is no foreign key relationship between the customers and transactions tables
